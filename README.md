Problems that I find interesting and explore and try to solve with my own solutions.

Gravity:

A visualization of mutual attraction between different objects similar to a gravitational force.
I made two versions, one where the objects are only attracted to the cursor and one where the objects attract each other as well. 
The size and color of the objects represent the mass of each object. 
Future improvements: collision dynamics and no overlapping.

Point Visualizer:

I wanted to explore the random movement of objects with freedom of 4 directions. All the objects are spawned in the center and then they're 
allowed to freely moved in a randomized way. The expected result should be a Gaussian Distribution. The yellow bars on the sides represent the 
amount of objects on that line.

Station Visualizer:

In the first Programming class we had in university we came across the problem of finding the shortest path between 3 zones where 
in the first and last zone we have one station, while in the second one we can have more. I Wanted to visualize the distance and I used
the color as a way of guessing: Bright red, max distance and black least distance. I also included more zones to make the visualization more interesting.

I then looked for the minimum distance in a very brute force way (it's not very efficient) and colored the shortest path as it's exploring.
This is the result.
